# example pedigree definition input file
# suggestion: pairwise comparisons labels and individual IDs should be simple and not contain spaces or special characters)

# first define individuals in pedigree (each with unique ID)
INDIVIDUALS
father
mother
child1
child2
wife
gchild
cousin
husband
inbred
stepmom
halfsib


# next define offspring relationships
RELATIONSHIPS
child1=repro(father,mother)
child2=repro(father,mother)
gchild=repro(child1,wife)
cousin=repro(child2,husband)
inbred=repro(child1,child2)
halfsib=repro(child1,stepmom)


# finally, define pairwise comparisons for which to calculate/output genetic distances and later perform plotting
COMPARISONS
Inbred_self=compare(inbred,inbred)        # IDENTICAL RELATIONSHIP (inbred offspring of siblings)
Twins_or_self=compare(father,father)      # IDENTICAL RELATIONSHIP
Parent_child=compare(father,child1)       # PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP
Siblings=compare(child1,child2)           # SIBLING RELATIONSHIP
GPGC=compare(mother,cousin)               # GRANDPARENT-GRANDCHILD RELATIONSHIP
Avuncular=compare(child2,gchild)          # AVUNCULAR RELATIONSHIP
Half-siblings=compare(gchild,halfsib)     # HALF-SIBLING RELATIONSHIP
Cousins=compare(cousin,gchild)            # COUSIN RELATIONSHIP
Unrelated=compare(father,mother)          # UNRELATED RELATIONSHIP
